                    A virtual currency is a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community.[1] It is commonly associated with blockchain, which is a public digital record of all transactions made in virtual currencies. In the recent years, virtual currencies have risen in popularity dramatically, especially with the growth of the BitCoin. <br/><br/>
                    Virtual currencies have existed since 1996, with E-Gold, a digital currency backed by gold, growing to be majorly successful for the time before falling victim to cybercrime and hacker attacks. Since then, a large number of virtual currencies have come to existence: many of which faded out; and a few which survived the test of time, such as WebMoney (since 1998).[2]<br/><br/>
                    Due to the anonymous nature of modern virtual currencies, they play a major role in the field of information security. Despite offering great utility to customers, such as being able to donate to causes anonymously, they are facing public scrutiny for their use in cybercrime and illicit activities, such as the purchase of drugs on the Deep Web, or their use in terrorism.[3]<br/><br/>

                Virtual currencies have faced strong opposition from governments, due to their untraceable and unregulatable. Recently, the Chinese government, among many others, has banned the currency as tender – and the currency has fought back. “The ethos behind blockchain has been tested," says Ken Sangha, COO of Open Money and the Open Project in San Francisco. "A central, organized and powerful authority -- China -- said 'no' and we all have been tested worldwide because of it. But the system flexed its muscles. It's doing what it was supposed to do.”[6]</br><br/>
                This is mainly due to the inherent nature of virtual currencies in that it is decentralised: it is impossible to regulate by central banks or governments. This results in wild volatility (abrupt changes in prices of a currency).</br><br/>
