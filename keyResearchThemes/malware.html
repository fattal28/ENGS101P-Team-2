            <div id="ma-text1" class="text-info">
                Malicious software, or “malware”, is software which is specifically designed to gain access to or damage a computer.. <sup>[1]</sup> Malware is therefore different from software which unintentionally causes harm to a user’s computer because malware is intended to be malicious.<br/><br/>

                (Percentage of malware infections by category <sup>[2]</sup>) <br/><br/>
                There are many different types of malware, but the most common ones are viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware.<br/><br/>
                ·       A virus is a program which, when executed, can reproduce itself and infect other programs or files, possibly modifying them in harmful ways. Viruses are usually attached to a program or file which needs to be executed in order for the virus to become active and infect other programs. This means that viruses remain inactive, not having any significant effect on the user’s computer, until this host program or file is activated. <sup>[3]</sup> <br/><br/> 
                ·       A worm is a standalone program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Unlike a virus, worms do not need a host program or file to run and propagate. Worms often exploit security flaws in a computer network to spread themselves to other computers.<br/><br/>
                ·       A Trojan horse is a malicious program which is designed to appear safe, useful and legitimate in an attempt to convince the computer user to install it. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses typically do not spread to other files or otherwise propagate themselves.<br/><br/>
                ·       Spyware is a blanket term for software which is designed to, without the user’s consent or knowledge, collect information about the user’s computer, and potentially send this information to a third party.  <br/><br/>

            </div>
            <div id="ma-text2" class="text-info">
                Malware has historically been created and deployed for a wide variety of purposes, from relatively harmless pranks perpetrated by single individuals, all the way to attacks as part of massive cyber crime operations. The most common uses of malware today are somewhere between these two.<br/><br/>
                The National Crime Agency estimates that the annual cost of cybercrime to the UK economy is billions of pounds. <sup>[3]</sup> The ways in which malware is employed by cybercriminals in becoming more and more sophisticated as time goes on. An example of this sophistication is the use of viruses and worms which are designed to take control of a user’s computer and make it part of a botnet (a large collection of computers whose security has been breached). These botnets can then be remotely controlled by a third party, against the wishes of the computer’s owner, to send spam, steal data, perform attacks on the computer infrastructure of corporations and to perform other illegal actions. Botnets “provide attackers with a distributed network of compromised systems from which they can work to defraud others with near anonymity.” <sup>[4]</sup><br/><br/>

                <h2>The future of malware research</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="ma-text3" class="text-info">
                One application of malware whose impact will continue to grow into the future is cyberwarfare. The global policy think tank RAND Corporation has defined cyber warfare as “actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks”. <sup>[5]</sup> The most famous case of cyber warfare is probably the ‘stuxnet’ worm, a computer worm believed to have been developed primarily by the United States for the purpose of damaging Iran’s nuclear program. <sup>[6]</sup> <br/><br/> 
                Research on malware and its possible applications will therefore not be confined to academic institutions, but will also be conducted on a wide scale by militaries, government agencies and also in the private sector, in order to develop defences against these types of cyber weapons.<br/><br/>
